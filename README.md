T tests:
1. Import the ‘iristtest.csv’ dataset. Browse and understand the data in each
column
2. Compute descriptive statistics and create boxplot for petal length and
species.
3. Select the appropriate t test to determine whether there is significant
difference in petal length between the two species. Make sure you check
whether the assumptions are met. Run the t test if the assumptions are met.
Use the standard template to report the result.
4. Import the ‘weightTtest.csv’ dataset. This dataset contains the weight of mice
before and after a specific treatment. Browse and understand the data in
each column
5. Compute descriptive statistics and create boxplot.
6. Select the appropriate t test to determine whether there is significant
difference in the weight before and after the treatment. Make sure you check
whether the assumptions are met. Run the t test if the assumptions are met.
Use the standard template to report the result.
ANOVA tests
7. Import the ‘iris.csv’ dataset. Browse and understand the data in each column
8. Compute descriptive statistics and create boxplot for sepal length and
species.
9. Select the appropriate test to determine whether there is significant
difference in sepal length between the three species. Follow the steps of
ANOVA analysis. Make sure you check whether the assumptions are met. If a
specific assumption is not met, you need to take specific action or make the
decision that ANOVA test is not suited for the data. Use the standard template
to report the result if ANOVA test is appropriate.
Note: If the homogeneity is not met, you need to transform the data to
logarithm. Sample code:
iris$Sepal.L.Log <- log(iris$Sepal.Length)
10. Import the ‘weightanova.csv’ dataset. This dataset contains the weight of
mice measured at 3 different time points. Browse and understand the data in
each column
11. Compute descriptive statistics and create boxplot to get some general
understanding of the data.
12. Select the appropriate test to determine whether there is significant
difference in weight between different time points. Follow the steps of
ANOVA analysis. Make sure you check whether the assumptions are met. If a
specific assumption is not met, you need to take specific action or make the
decision that ANOVA test is not suited for the data. Use the standard template
to report the result if ANOVA test is appropriate.
